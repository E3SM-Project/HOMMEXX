Each entry will have name(s) as for now, description, latex for it, and suggested name for a future.
Let's have 1 sentence per line.

Variable:
eta_dot_dpdn, eta_dot, eta_dpdn
Description:
A diagnostic quantity that is present in formulations for divergence operator. 
It is a product of material derivative of \eta (a new vertical coordinate) and partial derivative of pressure.
Though it is 'dpdn', last 'n' stands for \eta (shortcut).
See Chapter 12, eqn 12.7.
Latex:
$\dot{\eta}\frac{\partial p}{\partial \eta}$
Suggested:
None.

Variable:
A, B, ai, bi, am, bm, hybrid_ai, etc...
Description:
Coefficients for a hybrid pressure coordinate.
The hybrid pressure is given by p(\eta)=A(\eta)p_0 + B(\eta)p_{surface}.
Hybrid coefficients have to obey certain properties, so, often the safest is to read them from vcoodr files.
Latex:
Suggested:
None.

Variable:
rsplit
Description:
An integer that controls after how many dynamic steps vertical remap will be performed.
Latex:
Suggested:
None.


Variable:
phi, phis
Description:
Geopotential or surface geopotential, g*z, where g is grav. constant and z is height above surface.
Latex:
$\Phi$, $\Phi_s$
Suggested:
None.
