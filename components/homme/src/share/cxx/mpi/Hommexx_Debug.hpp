// Note: This does not seem to do much more than what the standard
//       MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL handling does. However, by calling
//       MPI_Abort, one can easily stop the execution in gdb by
//       setting a breakpoint at MPI_Abort:
//
//         (gdb) b MPI_Abort
//
//       Furthermore, we display additional details about the location
//       of the error (so that one knows where the problem is, even
//       when running outside of a debugger or without a breakpoint).
